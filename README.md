# soccer-teams-infos-scraper âš½

This is such a simple project. I needed to retrieve some info about soccer/football players and their respective teams.

## Install

`npm install`

## Use

Simply run `node app.js` and wait a little bit.

It'll create two files:

- `squads.json` with a list of teams based on http://www.footballsquads.co.uk/squads.htm/
- `players.json` with a list of all soccer players registered in this website, with name, nationality, position and current team
