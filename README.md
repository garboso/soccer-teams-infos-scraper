# soccer-teams-infos-scraper âš½

This is such a simple project. I needed to retrieve some info about soccer/football players and their respective teams. Use `npm install` to install required dependencies.

## Using

`npm run all`

It'll create two files:

- `squads.json` with a list of teams based on http://www.footballsquads.co.uk/squads.htm
- `players.json` with a list of all soccer players registered in this website, with name, nationality, position and current team

or you can run separately `npm run squads` and `npm run players`.
